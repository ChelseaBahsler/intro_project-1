    <li>the artist</li>
    <li>the description text</li>
    <li>a URL to the card image</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Categorization</h2>
  <p>A pokemon card can be categorized based on the card set that it was released in, its supertype, type, and subtype.</p>

  <h2>Associations</h2>
  <p>A pokemon card can be of different types and subtypes.</p>
  <p>A pokemon card can be only one supertype and is released in one set.</p>
  <p>A card set has information on its name, series, and release date.</p>
  <p>The faker location data is used to generate locations that the set is available to purchase.</p>
